## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - React framework

### What I learn

In this challenge I learned about rendering conditional styles dinamically with react.
I decided to do this challenge using tailwindcss and react to practice with these frameworks.

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on small details and finding new challenges to improve as a developer.

### Useful resources

- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me defining the styles. I really liked this css framework and will use it going forward.
